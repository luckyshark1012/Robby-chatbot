#### By integrating the strengths of Langchain and OpenAI, Robby-chatbot employs large language models to provide users with seamless, context-aware natural language interactions for a better understanding of their PDF and CSV data.ðŸ§ 
#### For better understanding, see my medium article ðŸ–– : [Build a chat-bot over your CSV data](https://medium.com/@yvann-ba/build-a-chatbot-on-your-csv-data-with-langchain-and-openai-ed121f85f0cd)

Robby-chatbot contains a chatbot with memory for differents types of files and a CSV-agent, both based on a given file. The chatbot discusses the elements of the file with the user in a user-friendly way from a vectorstore (max. 4 indexes at a time). 

Example of a chatbot:
Q: A restaurant in New York?
A: Try Tower Restaurant, a la carte menu and specials on Tuesdays. Contact: 0654589874.

The CSV Agent analyses the content and structure of the CSV without vectostore and answers questions in a factual manner. It requires clear and precise instructions and has no memory.

Example of a CSV agent:
Q: Square root of the average age?
A: 5.449689683556195
